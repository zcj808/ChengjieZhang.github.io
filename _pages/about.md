Hi, I am Chengjie Zhang, a third-year master's student from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), supervised by Chair Professor [Hong Zhang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=zhangh33&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2&lang=en). My current research focuses on imitation learning for robotic manipulation.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at SUSTech, majoring in Robotics Engineering under the supervision of [Professor Chenglong Fu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=fucl&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2&lang=en), working on human-robot interaction. Initially, I worked on controlling robotic arms through EEG, eye gaze, and EMG signals, and later engaged in research on assisted grasping based on mixed reality (MR). My undergraduate research experience enriched my research experience and enhanced my engineering skills, however, it did not significantly improve my theoretical abilities.

To address this, I joined associate professor [He Kong](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/konghe.html)â€™s research group, working on robotics acoustics and signal processing, primarily using nonlinear optimization techniques to achieve wireless signal source localization. I studied on algorithm design for calibrating indoor microphone arrays by robot and theoretical analysis on optimal sensor placement considering sensor position noises. The latter can be considered the peak of my theoretical research, as I derived a concise and practically meaningful equation. These achievements boosted my research confidence and motivated me to tackle more challenging and highly promising robotics problems, i.e., general and precise robotic manipulation.

If you are interested in my research, feel free to contact me.

<h3>Your Second Paper Title: Another Catchy Subtitle</h3>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengjie Zhang*, Co-author 1, Co-author 2</p>
<p><strong>Journal/Conference:</strong> <em>International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</em>, 2023</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Provide another brief summary of your second paper. Focus on a different aspect or contribution. "This paper presents a new approach for real-time human-robot interaction using mixed reality. We developed an intuitive visual feedback system that guides the human operator, enabling seamless collaboration on assembly tasks. Our user studies show significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional methods."</p>
